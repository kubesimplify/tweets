# Contributing / Documentation

## Example

Create a new file `tweets/hello-world.tweet` with the content

> Hello, world!

You can use subfolders, e.g. `tweets/2019-02/hello-world.tweet`, as long as the file is in the `tweets/` folder and has a file with this file extension `.tweet`

## Create a tweet with a twitter poll

A tweet including a poll must end with 2-4 options in the following format
```
Here is some text

( ) option A
( ) option B
( ) option C
( ) option D
```
## Notes

- Only newly created files are handled, whereas deletions, updates or renames are ignored.
- ***.tweet** files will not be created for tweets you send out directly from twitter.com
- ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you need to rename an existing tweet file, please do so locally using [`git mv old_filename new_filename`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-file-using-the-command-line), otherwise it may occur as deleted and added which would trigger a new tweet.
- your message must fit into a single tweet

You can have anything as <branch_name> , but by convention it should indicate what you are working on

```bash
mkdir <Dir_name>
```

# Steps to create a PR

git add .
git commit -m <Commit Message>
git push origin <branch_name> # this will push your changes to your github repo

- That's it you have made your pull request.ü•≥
